### **Ethical Hacking Technical Report**  
**Client: Department of Social Welfare and Development Region V**  
**Date: May 10, 2024**  
**Prepared by: Bardenas, John Paul O. and Samuela, Michelle M.**  

  **Executive Summary:** This report presents the technical findings of the ethical hacking assessment conducted for Department of Social Welfare and Development Region V website. The assessment aimed to identify vulnerabilities within the organization's network infrastructure, applications, and systems. Through various testing methodologies, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, critical and high-risk issues were discovered. This report provides detailed descriptions of these findings, along with actionable recommendations for remediation.

**Vulnerability Summary:**

**1. Social Engineering**
-  High: Phishing attacks, through clicking on unidentified links or messages, are a major threat to organizations, potentially leading to reputational harm and the exposure of sensitive data like passwords and personal IDs, including beneficiaries' sensitive information.

**2. Web Applications**
-  Critical: SQL injection involves injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields, exploiting database vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data such as household IDs, addresses, phone numbers, listed family members, and financial statements.

-  High: XSS attacks put harmful code into web pages. This can steal important information like login details or make users go to bad websites. For example, if a Municipal Link adds details about beneficiaries, they could accidentally send their information to harmful sites.

**3. Unchanged Router Passwords and Usernames for Municipal Link Stations**
-  Critical: Routers with default passwords and usernames are highly vulnerable to unauthorized access.

-  High: Unauthorized access enables attackers to manipulate network settings, intercept traffic, or launch other malicious activities, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

**4.  Weak Administrator Passwords**
-  Critical: Weak passwords for administrator accounts pose a critical security risk, as they can be easily guessed through brute-force attacks.

-  High:  the likelihood of unauthorized access to critical systems and resources to gain access and manipulate to sensitive information.

**5. Outdated and Unpatched Operating Systems**
-  Critical: Running outdated and unpatched operating systems exposes systems to critical vulnerabilities such as workstation of municipal links in the region.

-  High: Increased risk of exploitation by attackers if found outdated/unpatched.

**6. Lack of Regular Data Backup**
-  Critical: Failure to regularly back up data exposes organizations to data loss risks during system failures, cyber attacks, or accidental deletions, including critical information of beneficiaries loke in region V, which can amount to thousands of data entries.

**7.  Passwords Stored in Plaintext**
-  Critical: Storing passwords in plaintext poses a critical security risk, as they can be easily compromised like for system administrator.

-  High: Using outdated or weak hashing algorithms to store passwords increases the risk of password cracking attacks.

**8. Network Infrastructure:**
-  High: Firewall rules allow bypassing of firewall protections or unauthorized access to sensitive internal services (e.g., SSH) from external IP ranges to the ppis.dswd.gov.ph hostname.

**9. Directory Traversal**
-  High:  Directory traversal vulnerabilities can result in the exposure of confidential data stored on the web server or within the file system. This includes sensitive information such as financial records of beneficiaries, including salary details of families, senior citizen aid, as well as associated PDF files, images, and other related data.

**10: Error Handling in Web Pages**
-  High:  The ppis.dswd.gov.ph website lacks proper error handling for error messages. For example, exposing whether a username or password is correct during login attempts might enable brute-force attacks.

**Recommendation:**

**1. Social Engineering:**
-  Conduct regular training and secuirty awareness sessions to educate employees and beneficiaries about the dangers of phishing attacks and how to recognize suspicious links, emails or messages.

**2. Web Applications:**
-   Regularly sanitize input fields and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and educate developers on secure coding practices. Provide training to Municipal Links on the risks of XSS and how to avoid exposing sensitive information.

**3. Unchanged Router Passwords and Usernames for Municipal Link Stations:**
-   Implement strong password policies and regularly monitor router access logs for any suspicious activity.

**4. Weak Administrator Passwords:**
-  Conduct regular password audits or enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts, requiring complex passwords.

**5. Outdated and Unpatched Operating Systems:**
-  Regularly update operating systems on workstations and company laptops, including those used by Municipal Links, with the latest security patches and updates.

**6.Lack of Regular Data Backup:**
-  Implement a robust backup strategy that includes frequent, automated backups of all critical data, particularly the extensive beneficiary records. Store backups securely offsite.

**7.  Passwords Stored in Plaintext:**
-  Use bcrypt or Argon2, to securely hash passwords.

**8. Network Infrastructure:**
-  Require VPN authentication for remote access or limit access to specific IP ranges.

**9. Directory Traversal**
-  Implement error handling mechanisms and only users with administrative privileges should be granted access to sensitive directories.

**10. Error Handling in Web Pages**
-  Implement generic error messages that do not reveal specific details about the nature of the error. Utilize CAPTCHA or rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Executive Summary:** The findings of the ethical hacking assessment highlight several critical vulnerabilities and  security weaknesses within Department of Social Welfare and Development Region V organization's infrastructure and applications. By implementing the recommended remediation measures, Department of Social Welfare and Development Region V can significantly enhance its security posture and mitigate the risk of cyber threats and data breaches.
